PEBakery is new, improved implementation of WinBuilder 082.

PEBakery aims to resolve WinBuilder 082's abandoned bugs, and to be more plugin developer friendly builder.

## Main Goal

PEBakery's main goal is being able to build [Win10PESE](http://win10se.cwcodes.net/) perfectly.

## Disclaimer

- All implementation is only backed by documentation and blackbox testing, without violating WinBuilder 082's EULA.
- PEBakery is not a mature software, it can corrupt your system. I do not provide any warranty, use at your own risk.
- Even though I did not experienced data corruption while developing, it is highly recommended to backup your files.

## License

PEBakery is mainly licensed under GPL Version 3.

## Help Needed

PEBakery is waiting your contributions!

### Testing

PEBakery is in alpha stage, it needs a lot of testing.

- Try to build [Win10PESE](http://win10se.cwcodes.net/) with PEBakery and report bugs.
- If you are developer, you can contribute by writing unit tests.

### Undocumented WB082 behaviors

WB082 has lots of undocumented behaviors, and it takes time to inspect all of them. As a result, many commands behave different from WB082.

### UI

PEBakery needs more well-designed UI.

### Documents

PEBakery needs to be documented, especially for plugin developers.

- Design of PEBakery
- Command Grammar and Usage

### Optimization

It would be better to have more faster, robust PEBakery.

### Proposal

Plan PEBakery's future with your own hands!

- Add Useful Commands
- New Plugin Format
- New Language and Grammar

## Build

To compile PEBakery from source, Visual Studio and .Net Framework is required.

### Recommended

- Visual Studio 2017
- .Net Framework 4.7.1 Developer Pack

### Requirement

- C# 7 Compiler
- .Net Framework 4.7.1

## Documentation

See [PEBakery Manual](https://github.com/ied206/PEBakery/tree/docs/Manual).
