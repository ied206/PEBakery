# Exit

Forces the current plugin to terminate and continues processing with the next plugin.

## Syntax

```pebakery
Exit,<Message>[,NOWARN]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Message | Text that will be displayed and written to the log citing the reason for the `Exit`. |

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NOWARN | **(Optional)** Suppresses the Warning state in the log. |

## Remarks

Default behavior is to log the `Exit` action as a warning. If this is not a critical event you can override this behavior with the `NOWARN` flag.

If the plugin has defined the `System,OnPluginExit` directive the command will be processed before the plugin exits. This allows the developer to perform further logging and cleanup based on the reason for the `Exit`.
